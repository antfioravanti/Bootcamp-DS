# Bootcamp-DS
 This is a bootcamp that follows the material from the course **Python for Data Science and Machine Learning** on Udemy (link: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
 
 In this repository, I list several models explained in the bootcamp with notes as a personal reference and practice.
